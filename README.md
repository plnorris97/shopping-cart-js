# shopping-cart-js

## Description
This shopping cart app was created using the starter files for the freeCodeCamp tutorial, "JavaScript Project Tutorial: Shopping Cart" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_TZhCWbS3I). I followed along and commented out what was happening at each function to understand fully.

## About the Project
I tackled this project to practice manipulating and traversing the DOM. As mentioned, there are easier ways to go about a lot of this, but it is true Javascript DOM practice. This project first introduced me to immediately invoked function expressions which run when the page loads. 


## What's Different
Because the video did not talk about the `delete` or `clear cart` buttons, I will be finishing those items on my own.
